# Summary
For convenience, the key points of the book are summarized here. These are the core beliefs you will need to quit USM without pain and without falling back into the trap. Make sure you understand and agree with all of them. Go back to the relevant section and re-read if necessary.

1. USM offers virtually no real benefit or pleasure. It only appears to because it relieves the negative withdrawal symptoms, but these symptoms are caused themselves by social media. Non-addicts don't suffer them.
2. USM users use social media in order to end withdrawals and get rid of cravings. Both factors are caused by USM itself, and if you quit USM both will disappear
3. Quitting is difficult firstly because of the illusion that USM gives you real benefit or pleasure, and secondly because of the fear of quitting. Both are irrational.
4. Once those beliefs have been seen through, withdrawals and cravings pose no threat and quitting is easy.
