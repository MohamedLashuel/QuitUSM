# Difficulties in quitting
How do you quit a job? It's sort of a silly question. You say "I quit" and you never go back to the job again. With USM, it's easy to say "I quit" but the trouble lies in making sure you don't return.

## The willpower method
As stated previously, addicts both want to keep using and want to quit. The typical approach to quitting is to not address the desire to keep using and try to brute force it with willpower. If you are trying to resist your desire to use USM day in and day out with willpower alone, that is very difficult for a few reasons:

- You are constantly straining at the leash to fight against doing the very thing you want to do
- This stress is doubled without being able to turn to USM, which addicts are dependent on to deal with stress
- As you recover from addiction and withdrawal symptoms fade, the reasons you had for quitting start to disappear, and the want to use becomes stronger compared to the want to quit
- If you give in, it doesn't satisfy your cravings. Instead you want to use more and it is easy to fall back into your old ways
- USM appears more precious, like dieting makes unhealthy food more tempting

The hope is that if you can go long enough without using USM, the desire to use it will go away. This does work for many people, it sinks in that life is better without USM and the former addict can live freely. But overall, the rate of failure is high for the reasons I listed above. Even if one succeeds, since they haven't beaten the big monster they might be pining to use USM long after they kicked the physical addiction.

Quitting with willpower is hard because you are trying to not do something you desparately want to do.

## The fear of quitting
USM users are afraid to quit because they believe they are losing a crutch or genuine pleasure (believing the big monster). They fear that the emptiness and boredom they feel when not using USM will be with them forever (not understanding dopamine desensitization). They despair at the thought of never getting the pleasure of using USM again (the illusion of pleasure). By now you should realize that all of these feelings are irrational. There is also the fear of withdrawals and cravings which I have yet to address.

### Withdrawals and cravings
We already went over the physical effects of dopamine withdrawal: low mood, boredom, a feeling of something being missing, etc. These symptoms are experienced by USM users every day when they put down their phone, and are easily bearable on their own even for extended periods of time. The trouble with withdrawals is not the physical aspects, but the psychological ones. While feeling the symptoms, you think "If only I could use USM now, it would solve all my problems". The problems were caused by USM and all you need to do to get over them permanently is to bear temporary discomfort. 

During attempts to quit, the little monster will periodically pop up and cry out to be satisfied - a craving. This tends to happen in situations where you normally use USM, such as if you've made a habit of using it in bed before sleep, but can happen at any time. Then the big monster kicks in. It tells you that you'll never be satisfied without USM. It tries to negotiate with you, telling you just this once won't hurt. It tells you that you picked the wrong time to quit, or maybe you can just cut down instead. It says the suffering you're going through trying to quit isn't it worth it and that it's better to be an addict. 

Once you realize the big monster is entirely irrational and no longer believe what it says, cravings lose their power. Humans have enough self-awareness to be able to ignore the little monster if they truly believe it's for the better. What most people think of as cravings - getting a strong urge to use USM that you can't get over, stress and anxiety from not being able to use, etc. come from the big monster. Without the support of the big monster, cravings are little more than intrusive thoughts - annoying, but ultimately they have no power over you.

The pain from withdrawals and cravings is almost entirely mental.

You may still pull out your phone to open USM as habit, or think without realizing "I should open (your USM app of choice)". Like a spinning wheel, these habits will continue for some time, but if you don't give in to them or mope about them the wheel will eventually grind to a halt.

Let me clearly state that there is nothing to be afraid of in quitting at all, nor is it difficult, once you have removed the desire to use USM. Anyone who thinks it difficult to quit, or fears life after quitting, still has the big monster with them. Going back to the job example, if you quit a job you loathed and truly never wanted to work at again, would it be difficult to say "I quit" and never go back to that job? Of course not. It would only be a difficult process if you were torn between leaving and staying.

## Cutting down
The big monster is deathly afraid of quitting. When it senses you are serious about changing, it offers a compromise: cutting down instead. Seemingly this gets you the best of both worlds. Your big monster is happy it gets to use USM, and you are happy because the downsides of using are smaller. Addicts who try to cut down realize you are actually getting the worst of both worlds: you continue to suffer the addiction, keeping the little monster alive the whole time, while not getting any of the benefits of quitting. The nature of any addiction is to use more and more. It's actually harder to cut down than to quit entirely.

If you are thinking of quitting completely but doing it by gradually cutting down, you will run into the same problems. Why go through all the trouble? The withdrawal symptoms are mild, not like those for alcohol or other serious drugs where stopping abruptly can be dangerous.
